![test](https://github.com/Galitie/async-mobile-client-app/assets/105133862/fd37e584-51b6-4d03-8cb9-b0f026f374d0)


## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Godot, AWS

I worked on a small team to code the mobile web-app portion of this game using HTML, CSS and Javascript. The mobile web-app is responsive to all mobile screens and uses a websocket to connect to a AWS server.


## Lessons Learned:

- Working on a team while using GIT and GITHUB
- How to connect to a server via websocket
- Responsive layouts for different mobile browsers
