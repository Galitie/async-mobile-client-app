# Async Multiplayer Jackbox-like game
![test](https://github.com/Galitie/async-mobile-client-app/assets/105133862/fd37e584-51b6-4d03-8cb9-b0f026f374d0)


## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Godot/GDScript, AWS

I worked on a small team to code the game's mobile web app portion using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The mobile web app is responsive to all mobile screens and uses a WebSocket to connect to an AWS server. I also had a significant role in designing the game and did some coding in the game engine.


## Lessons Learned:

- Working on a team while using GIT and GitHub
- How to connect to a server via WebSocket
- Responsive layouts for different phones and mobile browsers
- Building modular sections of code so multiple people can work at the same time without merge conflicts
- Running playtests and focus groups

## Optimizations:

- Media query for the desktop version
- Look into different login options (currently IP address, but testing indicated that sometimes IP addresses can change)
- Building a better foundation for my next project so it's more modular and flexible
