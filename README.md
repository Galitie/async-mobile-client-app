# Async Multiplayer Game like Jackbox
A birthday present for a friend! I wanted to create a jackbox-like RPG that uses the player's phone for input.


## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Godot, AWS

I worked on a small team to code the mobile web-app portion of this game using HTML, CSS and Javascript. The mobile web-app is responsive to all mobile screens and uses a websocket to connect to the AWS server.


## Lessons Learned:

- Working on a team while using GIT and GITHUB
- How to connect to a server via websocket
